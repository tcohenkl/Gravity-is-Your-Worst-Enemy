# Gravity is Your Worst Enemy!

## Introduction
"Gravity is Your Worst Enemy" was created in the span of a month. This project was conceived to familiarize myself with C++ and its vast range of libraries. I wanted to challenge myself to not only understand the intricacies of the language but to also manage and organize a large-scale project and use github. Throughout the development process, I found it very challenging to imitate the nuances of space physics, particulary the inertia and momentum of the rocket ship movement and the complexities of rocket landing on a rotating planet. 

## Tech Stack
- **Language**: C++
- **Graphics**: SFML
- **Collisions**: Nick Koirala's Collision file

## Game Mechanics
Your mission: Navigate space and travel the furthest distance possible without crashing your ship.

- **Ship Movement**: Rotate your ship and thrust forward.
- **Gravity Fields**: Visible around each planet, they'll pull your ship in.
- **Landings**: Land with precision on a planet's thruster. Use the planet's rotation for strategic maneuvers. But remember, prolonged survival means faster planet spawn times...
- **Game Over**: Reflect on your journey with metrics on distance and survival time.
